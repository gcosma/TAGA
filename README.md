TAGA: Tabu Asexual Genetic Algorithm Embedded in a Filter/Filter Feature Selection Approach for High-dimensional Data

0 - Open the TAGA.m file
1- Load the dataset. The dataset is an n by m (n x m) matrix where n is the number of samples and m is the number of features
2- Set number of features to be filtered out in the first step (N_filter). This value is set to 100 features by default.
3- Set the sparameters of the GA. These parameters include population size, number of features in the final subset, number of iterations, and mutation rate.
By default, the values of these parameter have been set to: popsize:100, nfeat:10, maxiter:200, pm:0.2.
4- Run the TAGA.m file
